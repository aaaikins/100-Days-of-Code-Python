# Flash Cards

Flash Cards is a simple and interactive flashcard application built using Python and Tkinter. It helps users learn French vocabulary by showing a series of flashcards with French words and their English translations.

## Features

- **Randomized Flashcards:** Each flashcard shows a French word, and after 5 seconds, it reveals the English translation.
- **Track Progress:** Mark words as known, and the application will remove them from the list of words to learn.
- **Persistent Data:** The application saves your progress, so you can pick up where you left off.
